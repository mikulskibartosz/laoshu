While bridges with lengths exceeding\\n100 km are indeed remarkable achievements, engineers are likely curious about\\n**bridges with the longest span**. Since bridges come in various types, in\\nthis content, we will explore the longest-span bridges among common 3 types\\nsuch as arch bridge, cable-stayed bridge, and suspension bridge. We will refer\\nto the Guinness World Records to find out which bridge holds the record for\\nthe longest span. Bridges not found in the Guinness World Records have been\\nexcluded.\\n\\n## **1\\\\. Arch Bridge : PINGNAN THIRD BRIDGE 575m (1,886 ft)**\\n\\n![PINGNAN THIRD BRIDGE](https://www.motivewith.com/hs-\\nfs/hubfs/MOTIVE_Image/Worlds%20Longest%20Bridge%20Spans%20\\\\(by%20Types\\\\)/PINGNAN%20THIRD%20BRIDGE.png?width=1280&height=854&name=PINGNAN%20THIRD%20BRIDGE.png)\\n\\nPingnan Third Bridge (c) The Architect's Diary.com\\n\\nThe longest arch bridge is the Pingnan Third Bridge, a road crossing which\\nspans the Xunjiang river near Pingnan in Guangxi, China. The Pingnan Third\\nBridge boasts a primary span measuring 575 meters (1,886 feet) and an entire\\nlength of 1,035 meters (3,395 feet).\\n\\nIt is classified as a through-arch bridge, characterized by a deck that hangs\\nbeneath the supporting arch through cables. If you have an interest in various\\ntypes of arch bridges, you can explore them through this link: [How do we\\ndistinguish the arch bridge according to the deck position?](/en/blog/arch-\\nbridge-type?hsLang=en)\\n\\n## **2\\\\.

The bridge connects Vladivostok to Russky Island in Russia and\\nwas officially inaugurated on 2 July 2012.\\n\\n## **3\\\\.

The bridge is designed to allow easier travel from Turkey's\\nEuropean and Asian provinces.  \\n  \\nThe reason the span is precisely 2023 meters is that the Turkish government\\nintended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic\\nin 2023.  \\n  \\nWith a span length of 2023 meters, the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge now holds the\\nrecord for the world's longest suspension bridge span and the world's longest\\nbridge span.\\n\\n## **Reference**\\n\\nGuinnessworldrecords.com : [Longest span arch\\nbridge](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-bridge-\\nsteel-arch-bridge)\\n\\nGuinnessworldrecords.com : [Longest cable-stayed bridge\\nspan](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/106998-longest-\\nbridge-span-cable-stayed-bridge)\\n\\nGuinnessworldrecords.com : [Longest suspension bridge\\nspan](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-bridge-cable-\\nsuspension-bridge)\\n\\nGuinnessworldrecords.com : [Longest bridge\\nspan](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/420795-longest-\\nbridge-span)\\n\\n**About the MOTIVATOR**\\n\\n![](https://www.motivewith.com/hubfs/Enside%20%EC%A0%84%EB%AC%B8%EA%B0%80%20\\\\(EN\\\\)/Jegeon%20240_240.png)\\n\\n_Jegeon_ _Ryu_\\n\\nProject Manager & Content Creator MOTIVE\\n\\nHello, I am Jegeon Ryu, a Project Manager responsible for developing MOTIVE\\nfor engineers dedicated to creating a safer and better world.
