This massive viaduct, completed in 2011, formed a crucial part of the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway and was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the longest bridge in the world in any category [2](https://www.thortech.co.uk/bridges/5-of-the-worlds-longest-bridges/) [3](https://www.motivewith.com/en/get-motivated/world-longest-bridge-span-by-types). The bridge required approximately 10,000 workers over four years to complete and cost around $8.5 billion [3](https://www.motivewith.com/en/get-motivated/world-longest-bridge-span-by-types).
