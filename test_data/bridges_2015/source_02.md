1. Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge, China

The longest bridge in the world (and by a considerable distance) is the Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge in China. Built in 2010, this high-speed rail bridge is 164,800 metres in length, and some 102.4 miles long. The bridge connects Beijing to Nanjing and is a section of the Beijing to Shanghai high-speed railway. It took around 10,000 people, over a period of four years, to build the bridge, while the construction cost was around $8.5 billion.
