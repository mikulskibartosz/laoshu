## Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge: The Longest Bridge in the World

The Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge is officially the longest bridge in the world. It stretches out for no less than 102.4 miles (164.8 kilometres) and forms part of one of China‘s most important railway connections: the high-speed train between Beijing and Shanghai.

After it was unveiled on 30th June 2011, it was recognised by the Guinness World Records as the longest bridge in the world. Its numbers are certainly astounding, as it towers at 100 feet (30 metres) high and had more than 10,000 people work on its construction.

If you ever find yourself travelling on a fast train over this bridge, you’ll gaze out at the beautiful scenery. Lowlands, lakes, rivers and rice paddies will flash past the train window while you admire the views.
